redux provide global access of some state.
let say some component requird login state for them a state stores in common storage. and  available for evry component its use of redux

benifits is reduce the prop drilling 
also common storage access



useReducer ==> these things available in useReducer

reducer
Initial state
dispatch
action
type
payload

reducer => its function and it perfrom all the data manuplation logic.
Initial=>state => your state when your app intitally render
dispatch => it is a function which one use for pass action object to the reducer function when action occures into the component
action => this is object passed by dispatch it contains type and payload
type => its string value for perticuler action
payload => it has value


redux => single source of truth.. it mean for every state change only on storage

flow => 
Initial-state---> reducer ----> storage(stores state changes its global)---> conecter(connect storage to component)--->component--->dispatch --->reducer(repeat) same way bcz its unidirction
